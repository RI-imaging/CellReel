Citing CellReel
===============
If you are using CellReel in a scientific publication, please
cite it with:

::

  (...) using CellReel version X.X.X (available at
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cellreel).

or in a bibliography

::
  
  Paul MÃ¼ller (2021), CellReel version X.X.X: Fluorescence and
  refractive index Tomography [Software]. Available at
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cellreel.

and replace ``X.X.X`` with the version of CellReel that you used.


Furthermore, several ideas implemented in CellReel have been described
and published in scientific journals:

- The original paper that employed a prototype of CellReel for
  combined refractive index and fluorescence tomography
  :cite:`Schuermann2017`.

- Phase retrieval from holographic images with a gaussian
  filter is implemented according to :cite:`Schuermann2015`.

- Phase background image correction with a tilt fitted to a
  border of the image data was used in :cite:`Schuermann2015` and
  :cite:`Schuermann2016`.

- Phase background image correction with a polynomial fitted to
  known background regions was introduced for DHM in :cite:`Colomb2006`
  (in this reference the phase correction is applied to the hologram
  data before field reconstruction).
